    <h3>Objective and basic concepts</h3>
    <p>The objective in Minesweeper is to find and mark all the mines hidden under the squares, in the shortest
        time possible. This is done by clicking on the squares to open them. Each square will have one of the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A mine, and if you click on it you'll lose the game.</li>
        <li>A number, which tells you how many of its adjacent squares have mines in them.</li>
        <li>Nothing. In this case you know that none of the adjacent squares have mines, and they will be automatically
            opened as well.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is guaranteed that the first square you open won't contain a mine, so you can start by clicking any square.
        Often you'll hit on an empty square on the first try and then you'll open up a few adjacent squares as well,
        which makes it easier to continue. Then it's basically just looking at the numbers shown, and figuring out where
        the mines are.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>There are essentially five actions you can take in Minesweeper:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a square. This is done simply by left clicking on a square.</li>
        <li>Marking a square as a mine. This is done by right clicking on a square. A little flag icon will show up
            there.</li>
        <li>Clear any marks. Again, right click on the square. Right clicking cycles through the following states: Flag
            and Clear.</li>
        <li>Opening all remaining adjacent squares to a number square. If for example you have a square with the number
            1 and you have already marked one mine in one of the adjacent squares you can double click on the 1 square
            and the remaining adjacent squares will all be opened. This can save a lot of time while trying to quickly
            clear out squares. If you press on a number where not all adjacent mines have been marked, e.g. the number
            is 3 and you've only flagged one adjacent square, then the squares will not be opened, to prevent you from
            accidentally clicking on a number and blowing yourself up!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Winning</h3>
    <p>You've won the game when you've opened all squares that don't contain a mine. If you've opened all the empty/nr
        squares but haven't flagged the mine squares remaining, they will be auto-flagged and you have won. So,
        essentially flagging is not required, it's only there to help you keep track of where you think the mines are.
        The real way to win is open all the non-mine squares. This can be used to gain a tiny bit of speed if you're
        trying to improve your time :)</p>
